## Game > Gamebase > Overview

Gamebase is a strongly recommended service as it embraces a decade's operational knowhow of NHN Entertainment, which is the leading game platform provider. 
It only takes Gamebase SDK to make easy use of common game services.

## Key Features

### Authentication

Gamebase supports OAuth login based on ID and passwords, using accounts of many identity providers (IdPs); guest login by using UUID of a device. Its authentication service is based on member information provided by external IdP, without having its own member system. In other words, user's ID or passwords are not saved in Gamebase.

* **Provides many authentication methods via single interface. **
  Development costs can be saved by enabling external IdP development easier and faster.  Developers can easily implement authentication without concerning complicated procedure and legal or policy issues.

* **Provides various external IdP authentication methods.**
  Provided external authentication is to be continuously updated, and if there is any other authentication you'd like to include, contact [Customer Center](https://toast.com/support/inquiry).

Following is the list of external authentication supported by Gamebase.

| External Authentication             | Android | iOS | Windows(based Unity) | Web(based JavaScript)    |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Facebook          | O | O | O | O |
| Apple Game Center |  | O | | |
| Google            | O | O | O | O |
| PAYCO             | O | O | O | O |
| NAVER             | O | O | O | O |
| Twitter			| O | O | |  |
| LINE				| O | O |  |  |

* **Provides guest logins.**
  With guest login, users can log in and start a game without any authentication required. As Gamebase user ID is issued even to guest users, game data can be managed for all users, regardless of OAuth or guest login
  
* **Provides independent member identification.**
  On a first-time login, Gamebase user ID is automatically created, which can be used as user identifier in a game. User ID is issued to all users, regardless of authentication method, and is not inclusive to a particular IdP, so user processing is available in the same method throughout any IdP.
  
* **Provides log-out and withdrawal.**
  You can choose to log out and log in again from different authentication, and if you withdraw from a game, user ID will be deleted from Gamebase with all related information.
  
* **Provides mapping so that a game user can use multiple external IdPs at the same time.**
  For example, a game user with Facebook authentication can use the same ID with Google authentication. If Facebook authentication is mapped with Google authentication to a user ID, the user can play games with Facebook authentication and Google authentication, each on two different devices.

### Launching

A game app in service requires lots of information when it first launches. Gamebase provides data required to operate the game app during initial execution, which is called Launching. 
Launching data can be set in the Gamebase Console in real time, and the changes can be checked when initializing SDK or at game launching status.

Following information is provided by Gamebase for launching.

* App status
  * Whether to update game client, and download URL
  * Maintenance information
* Urgent notice
* Authentication
* URL list of in-app games

### For Global

Gamebase basically supports global games, and provides following functions to that purpose:

* Provides user messages in multiple languages.
  * User messages can be entered in multiple languages via console, but, language set follows user device's setting. If Korean, English, and Japanese are entered via console, users of Korean device will be displayed with Korean messages.
* Allows filtering by country.
  * In case urgent notice or push messages are directed at users of a particular country during game operations, the messages can be sent to a specified country only. 
* Selects operator's local time zone to enter time at ease.
  * If a game is run in Vietnam, Vietnamâ€™s time zone can be selected and entered, with no need to convert to Korean time.

### Other TOAST Services

* Supports easier interfaces to TOAST service that a game requires.
  * Gamebase provides wrapped APIs on the basis of Gamebase User IDs. Therefore, users don't need to make separate calls to each service's API.
  * [Notification > PUSH](http://www.toast.com/service/notification) : Integrated push service to send push messages
  * [Common > IAP](http://www.toast.com/service/iap) : Integrated In-App Purchase service
  * [Game > Leaderboard](http://www.toast.com/service/leaderboard) : Real-time large-capacity ranking service
  * [Security > AppGuard](https://cloud.toast.com/service/security) : Prevents code manipulation of applications in real time
