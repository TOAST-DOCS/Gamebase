## Game > Gamebase > Android Developer's Guide > Purchase

This page describes how to set In-App Purchase (IAP).

Gamebase provides an integrated purchase API to easily link IAP of many stores in a game.

### Initialization

> <font color="red">[Caution]</font><br/>
>
> ONE Store v17, v19, and v21 are supported.
> For ONE Store, you can use only one of the following versions: v17, v19, v21, or external, but not at the same time.

* Store code must be specified to initialize Gamebase. 
* Select **STORE_CODE** among the following:  
    * GG: Google Play
    * ONESTORE: ONE Store
    * GALAXY: Galaxy Store
    * AMAZON: Amazon Appstore
    * HUAWEI: Huawei AppGallery
    * MYCARD: MyCard

```java
String STORE_CODE = "GG";	// Google

GamebaseConfiguration configuration = GamebaseConfiguration.newBuilder(APP_ID, APP_VERSION, STORE_CODE)
        .build();

Gamebase.initialize(activity, configuration, callback);
```

### Purchase Flow

Purchase of an item can be divided into **Purchase Flow**, **[Consume Flow](./aos-purchase/#consume-flow)**, and **[Reprocess Flow](./aos-purchase/#retry-transaction-flow)**.
It is recommended to implement the **Purchase Flow** in the following order:

![purchase flow](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/DevelopersGuide/purchase_flow_001_2.10.0.png)

1. If the previous purchase was not completed normally, the purchase will fail if the reprocessing is not performed. Therefore, call **requestItemListOfNotConsumed** before the purchase to run reprocessing, so that the Consume Flow is executed if there are any unprovided items.
2. The game client attempts to make a purchase by calling **requestPurchase** of the Gamebase SDK.
3. If the purchase is successful, call **requestItemListOfNotConsumed** to check the unconsumed purchase details, and if there is an item to provide, proceed with the Consume Flow.

### Consume Flow

If there's a value on the list of unconsumed purchases, proceed with the **Consume Flow** in the following order:

> <font color="red">[Caution]</font><br/>
>
> To prevent duplicate provision of an item, always check whether the item is being provided in duplicate in the game server.
>

![consume flow](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/DevelopersGuide/purchase_flow_002_2.40.1.png)

1. The game client makes a request to the game server to consume the purchase item.
    * Passes UserID, gamebaseProductId, paymentSeq, and purchaseToken.
2. The game server checks the game DB to see if there is a history of already providing an item with the same paymentSeq.
    * 2-1. If the item has not been provided yet, call the Gamebase server's Payment Transaction API to verify that the paymentSeq and purchaseToken values are valid.
        * [Game > Gamebase > API Guide > Purchase(IAP) > Get Payment Transaction](./api-guide/#get-payment-transaction)
    * 2-2. If purchaseToken is a normal value, provide the item corresponding to gamebaseProductId to UserID.
    * 2-3. After providing the item, store UserID, gamebaseProductId, paymentSeq, and purchaseToken in the game DB to prevent duplicate provision or allow for re-provision.
3. Regardless of whether the item has been provided, the game server completes the item provision by calling the Gamebase server's consume API.
    * [Game > Gamebase > API Guide > Purchase(IAP) > Consume](./api-guide/#consume)

### Retry Transaction Flow

![retry transaction flow](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/DevelopersGuide/purchase_retry_transaction_flow_2.19.0.png)

* There are cases where the store purchase has been made successfully but the process was not properly completed due to errors.
* Call **requestItemListOfNotConsumed** to run reprocessing and proceed with the [Consume Flow](./aos-purchase/#consume-flow) for any unprovided items.
* It is recommended to call reprocessing at the following times:
    * After login is completed
    * Before making a purchase
    * When entering the store (or lobby) in a game
    * When checking the user profile or mailbox

### Purchase Items

Request purchase by calling the following API using the gamebaseProductId of the item to purchase.<br/>
The gamebaseProductId is generally the same as the ID of item registered at the store, but it can be changed in the Gamebase console. 

When a game user cancels purchase, the **GamebaseError.PURCHASE_USER_CANCELED** error is returned.
Please process cancellation.

**API**

```java
+ (void)Gamebase.Purchase.requestPurchase(@NonNull final Activity activity,
                                          @NonNull final String gamebaseProductId,
                                          @NonNull final GamebaseDataCallback<PurchasableReceipt> callback);
```

**Example**

```java
Gamebase.Purchase.requestPurchase(activity, gamebaseProductId, new GamebaseDataCallback<PurchasableReceipt>() {
    @Override
    public void onCallback(PurchasableReceipt receipt, GamebaseException exception) {
        if (Gamebase.isSuccess(exception)) {
            // Succeeded.
        } else if(exception.getCode() == GamebaseError.PURCHASE_USER_CANCELED) {
            // User canceled.
        } else {
            // To Purchase Item Failed cause of the error
        }
    }
});
```

**API**

```java
+ (void)Gamebase.Purchase.requestItemListPurchasable(Activity activity, GamebaseDataCallback<List<PurchasableItem>> callback);
```

**Example**

```java
Gamebase.Purchase.requestItemListPurchasable(activity, new GamebaseDataCallback<List<PurchasableItem>>() {
    @Override
    public void onCallback(List<PurchasableItem> data, GamebaseException exception) {
        if (Gamebase.isSuccess(exception)) {
            // Succeeded.
        } else {
            // Failed.
            Log.e(TAG, "Request item list failed- "
                    + "errorCode: " + exception.getCode()
                    + "errorMessage: " + exception.getMessage());
        }
    }

}
```

### List Non-Consumed Items

* List non-consumed consumables (CONSUMABLE) and consumable subscriptions (CONSUMABLE_AUTO_RENEWABLE).
* In case there is any non-purchased item, request the game server (item server) to proceed with item delivery (provision).
* If the purchase is not completed normally, this API also serves the reprocessing function, so call it in the following situations:
    * Check if there's any unprovided items for a game user
    	* After login is completed
    	* When entering the store (or lobby) of a game
    	* When checking the user profile or mailbox
    * Check if there's any item in need of reprocessing
    	* Before making a purchase
    	* After a purchase fails

        }
    }
});
```


### List Status of Subscriptions

You can view the status of purchased subscription products based on your current user ID.
Subscription products that have been paid for (auto-renewable subscriptions, auto-renewable consumable subscription products) can be viewed until they expire.
You can retrieve the status of expired subscription products with the **PurchasableConfiguration.setIncludeExpiredSubscriptions(true)** API.
For subscription status codes, see the following document.
 [NHN Cloud > SDK User Guide > IAP > Android > NHN Cloud IAP Class Reference > IapSubscriptionStatus.StatusCode](https://docs.nhncloud.com/en/TOAST/en/toast-sdk/iap-android/#iapsubscriptionstatusstatuscode).

> <font color="red">[Caution]</font><br/>
>
> * The subscription status code is only returned correctly if you follow the guide below to set up the subscription event.
>     * Go to [Game > Gamebase > Store Console Guide > Google Console Guide and set up event propagation of real-time subscription information within Google's system](./console-google-guide/#google_1)
>     * The status code for a subscription product purchased without setting up events always returns 0 (PURCHASED).
> * Subscription products currently only supports Google Play Store.
