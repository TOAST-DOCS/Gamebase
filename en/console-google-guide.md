> [Notice]
> This document covers how to register and link the information of apps released on Google Play to the [Gamebase IAP](https://docs.toast.com/ko/Game/Gamebase/ko/oper-purchase/) console.
> For more details on console settings to release apps on Google Play, refer to the Google Play Console guide provided by Google.


## Google site
We use the Google site below to get the information for the integration.
- [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/developers)
- [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- [Google Developers - OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/)

## Enter Basic Information

![Store Information Registration](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_01.png)


### 1. Store App ID

- The Package Name of the app you build for Google Play registration, a unique value that identifies your app within Google Play.
- If you've registered your app, you can see it in your app list in the Google Play Console, or in your dashboard.

### 2. Google InApp Purchase License Key
- Access the Google Play Console to verify your license.
- From **Home**, select the app you want to set up and enter the **Monetization setup**.
- Copy and paste the Base64-encoded portion of the item from **License**.

### 3. Skip Market Integration Verification

- Set to **NO**, which is usually the default, as an option in case of a Google outage.
- When set to **YES**, it only checks for tampering with the sent payment information and skips verification by Google.
- Do not apply to all payments, and subscriptions and revalidations are excluded.

## Two Authentication Methods for Integration

- To integrate with Google, you must use the Google Cloud API, which requires OAuth2.0 authorization provided by Google.
- Gamebase IAP supports the **Client ID** and **service account** methods among Google OAuth2.0 authentications.
- In the Gamebase IAP integration methods, the client ID is mapped to **SUPERVISOR** and the service account is **to SERVICE_ACCOUNT**.
- The differences between the two are summarized below, and you can read more about them in [Google's OAuth 2.0 guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2?hl=ko).

**[Client ID method]**
- Create a client ID and credentials to use for authentication on behalf of the user.
* While creating credentials, an approval from a Google user (developer) is required. 
* Authorization happens only once on the web, and the generated credentials and authorization results are returned to the website.
- When you use the Google Cloud API with an authorized client ID, you have the same permissions as the authorized user.
- If the credentials are generated by the user who creates (owns) Google Play Console, then that client ID can access any app within Google Play Console.

**[Service account method]**
- In the Google Cloud Console, you can create a service account for your project. A service account is not a regular user account with a Google email. 
- Google Play Console adds and uses the service account you created in Google Cloud Console.
- In order for the service account to access the app, you must grant the appropriate permissions.

## Set up Google Cloud Project

- To integrate with apps registered on Google Play, you require a Google Cloud project.
- You can use an existing project if you already have one, but you can learn how to create a Google Cloud project first.

### 1. Create a project

- Access the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to create a project.
- Sign in as the user who owns the Google Play Console developer account.
- Select **IAM & Admin > Create Project**.
- Create a project by entering a **project name** and **location**.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_06.png)


### 2. Add APIs to Use in Your Project

- Select the project you created, and navigate to the **APIs & Services > Library** menu.
- Select the API you want to use from **API Library**. The following APIs are required to integrate with apps registered in Google Play.
    - **Play Android Developer API**
    - **Play Games Services Publishing API**
- Select the appropriate API and enable it in the **Product Details**.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_07.png)

### 3. Show the Google Cloud Console Menu

- If you have an invisible menu during the setup process, such as Google Cloud Pub/Sub, you can add it to your menu (pinned products) by navigating to **Products & Solutions > All Products**.

## Set up SUPERVISOR integration

To use Google Cloud Client ID authentication in Gamebase IAP, you need a Refresh token created with your client ID. While creating a Refresh token, there is a user authorization process, and you need to configure the **OAuth consent screen** in your Google Cloud project. The access permissions of apps registered in Google Play Console are based on the permissions of the user who approved the Refresh token generation.


### 1. Configure the OAuth Consent Screen

- If you haven't configured the **OAuth consent** screen before creating a client ID, you must do so first.
- **In APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**, configure the screen that users will see when they authorize the creation of their credentials.
- If you're not using Google Workspace, you can only select **External** for **User Type**.
- Follow the **Learn more** on the screen for other configuration-related settings.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_09.png)


### 2. Create a Google Cloud Client ID

- **Under APIs & Services > User Credentials**, select **Create User Credentials > OAuth Client ID** at the top to enter the **Create OAuth client ID** page.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_10.png)

- For **Application type**, select **web application**.
- Enter a **name** to identify the client ID.
- The **authorized redirect URI** is the address to which the result will be returned after user authorization on the **OAuth consent screen** you set up earlier. If you set the **application type** to **web application**, you will receive the approved authorization code over the web.
- If you want to receive the authentication results in a separate user web application, you can also set the user's web address. In this example, we'll use the Google Developers site to verify the credentials.
- For **authorized redirect URI**, enter ```https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground```.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_11.png)

- Click **Create** to create an OAuth client, and you'll see the **client ID** and **client security password**.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_12.png)


### 3. Create a Refresh Token with OAuth Client

- Access the [Google Developers - OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground) to generate a Refresh token.
- **In Step 1**, select https:``` //www.googleapis.com/auth/androidpublisher``` of **Google Play Android Developer API v3** used for authentication.
- Click the gear button in the top right to open the **OAuth 2.0 configuration** , and check **Use your own OAuth credentials** to bring up additional fields.
- Enter the **client ID** and **client security password** created earlier in **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client secret**.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_13.png)

- Click the **Authorize APIs** button, and on the next sign-in page, sign in as a user with a Google Play Console developer account.
- When you sign in, you'll be taken to the page you configured in the **OAuth consent screen** menu.
- After clicking **Continue**, you will be redirected to **Step 2** of **Google Developers - Oauth 2.0 Playground**.

- **On the OAuth consent screen**, if your **publishing status** is Test, you might see the **Apps not verified by Google** screen.

- If you didn't enter ```https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground``` in the **authorized redirect URI** when you created your client ID, you cannot receive results.
- If you are redirected successfully, you can verify your **authorization code in Step 2**.
- Here, click **Exchange authorization code for tokens** to get a **Refresh token and Access token**.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_14.png)

- You don't need to proceed with **Step 3**.

### 4. Set up Client Information in Gamebase IAP app

- In **Gamebase IAP > App > Add**, enter the information you verified in Google Cloud Console and Google Developers.
- **Google API Client ID**: Enter your **client ID**
- **Google API Client Secret**: Enter your **client security password**
- **Refresh Token For Google Oauth**: Enter the **Refresh token** received from the Google Developers OAuth Playground

> [Caution]
> The Refresh token issued will expire immediately if you change the password of the user account you authenticated with. If your app is live, this can cause a failure.
> There are other reasons for expiration, please check out [Google's OAuth 2.0 guide - Refresh token expiration](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2?hl=ko#expiration).


## Setting up the SERVICE_ACCOUNT Integration Method

You can issue service accounts in Google Cloud IAM to allow non-human users to access Google Cloud resources. For differences from user accounts and operational strategies, see the Google Cloud IAM documentation or the [Google Cloud Authentication documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication?hl=ko#credentials).


### 1. Create a Google Cloud Services Account

- **In IAM & Admin > Service accounts**, click **Create Service Account**, or in **APIs & Services > User credentials**, select **Create User Credentials > Service Account**.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_15.png)

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_16.png)

- Enter the appropriate information for the **service account name** and **service account ID**, then click **Create and Continue** to proceed to the next step.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_17.png)

- To grant access, select **Owner**.


![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_18.png)

- You can then complete or register additional administrator emails for the service account. Registering an admin email gives you administrative permissions for the service account you're creating. If the registered email isn't currently working on a project, you'll receive an invitation.


### 2. Generate a key for your Google Cloud Services account

- Click the created service account to view its details.
- Go to the **Keys** tab and select **Add key > Create new key**.
- Select **JSON** for the **key type** and click **Create** to download the key file.
- The contents of the downloaded file are used to set up the NHN Cloud IAP app.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_19.png)

> [Caution]
> Once downloaded, the key file for a service account cannot be re-downloaded. If you lose the key, you must destroy it and generate a new one.
> Also, remember that keys can use any permissions you've granted to the service account, so be extra careful about key security.


### 3. Register a Service Account with Google Play Console

- Access Google Play Console.
- In **Users and permissions**, click the **Invite new user** button.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_20.png)

- Enter the service account email you created on the Invite users screen. Do not check **Set access expiration date**.
- Permissions can be granted on a per-app basis by adding applications under the service account, or they can be granted to the service account you register with. Here, we're registering with account permissions**.
- Set the scope to match your intent, but make sure to select **View app info and bulk download reports (read-only), View financial data, order, and cancel survey responses**, and **Manage orders and subscriptions**.
- It will take some time for your permission settings to be reflected. In some cases, it can take as long as 7 days.
- Service accounts are activated after invitation without requiring email authorization from the user.

> Google's regular user account can also access the Google Cloud API through the client ID, just like the SUPERVISOR method, as long as the project is registered as a primary member in Google Cloud and the user is invited and authorized in the Google Play Console.


### 4. Set up a Service Account in the Gamebase IAP app

- In **Gamebase IAP > App > Add**, in the **Service account integration information** field, enter the contents of the key file for the downloaded service account.
- When copying, use a text editor like notepad to copy the entire content.

## Set up Google Notifications to receive real-time subscription status

If you sell subscription products on Google Play, you can receive notifications from Google in Gamebase IAP to manage the latest status of your subscriptions. Subscription products are automatically renewed within Google at the time of renewal. To track these subscription events within Google, you use **Topics** in Google Cloud. You can learn more about topics in [Android Developers - Creating topics](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/getting-ready#create-topic).

### 1. Create a Google Cloud Notification topic

- Access [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- **In Pub/Sub**,click **Create a topic**.
- Create a topic by entering **a topic ID, adding a default subscription**, and selecting a **Google-managed encryption key**
- If you don't see the **Pub/Sub** menu, you can access it **from Products & Solutions > All Products**.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_23.png)

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_24.png)

- Once the topic is created, you need to add a publisher to post to the topic when a subscription event occurs. Select the created topic and click **Add primary member** on the **Permissions** tab.
- Select ```google-play-developer-notifications@system.gserviceaccount.com``` for the **new primary member, publish/subscribe publisher** for the **role**, and save.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_25.png)


### 2. Set up Subscriptions to Publish to the Topic

- When you create a topic, you'll see a subscription for that topic created alongside it in the **Subscriptions** menu.
- Go to modify subscription, select **Push** for **Delivery type**, and enter ```https://api-iap.cloud.toast.com/callback/subscription/{YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME}/GG```as the **endpoint URL** to receive notifications from Gamebase IAP. When entering, ```{YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME}```must be replaced with the same value as the Store App IDduring the Gamebase IAP app basic information entry above.
- If you're using the Gamebase sandbox, enter the **endpoint URL** as ```https://sandbox-api-iap.cloud.toast.com/callback/subscription/{YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME}/GG```.
- If you want to add a subscription to an already created topic, you can also add a subscription with Create Subscription.

![Link a Google Cloud Project](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/StoreConsoleGuide/GooglePlay/en/260202_en_26.png)

### 3. Register a Subscription Topic in Google Play Console

- From the **home** screen, select the apps you want to receive notifications for and enter the **monetization settings**.
- Under **Google Play Payments**, in **Topic name**, enter the name of the topic that you created earlier.
