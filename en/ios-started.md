## Setting

Gamebase can be setup as below.

### Download

* [Download Gamebase iOS SDK](/Download/#game-gamebase)

Download Gamebase.xcframework.zip and required adapters.<br/>
Also download SDK files to authenticate each IdP, which are required only for a login.<br/>
Then, include corresponding SDK files to a target of your project.

> When adding the AuthenticationServices.framework required for Sign In with Apple, it must be set to Optional.
> If it is set to Required, the devices running on iOS version 11 or earlier crashes immediately after launching the app.
> 
> Gamebase SDK iOS 2.13.0 or later supports Sign In with Apple in iOS 9 or later, and additionally the Service ID needs to be set in the Gamebase Console.

<br/>

> <font color="red">[Caution]</font><br/>

> The Gamebase Framework files that contain **Adapter** in their name can be selected to determine whether they will be used within the project or not. It is recommended to remove any unused Adapter Frameworks.
> To use these Adapter Frameworks, the external SDKs specified in the above table might be required.
> For some Auth Adapters, be aware of the supported iOS versions listed in the table above.
> (If an Auth Adapter that supports iOS version 11 or later is included in the build, it will crash on iOS 10 or earlier.)

### Xcode Settings

By decompression, following SDKs will show, including Gamebase.xcframework.

![unzip gamebase](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/iOSDevelopersGuide/ios-developers-guide-installation-002_2.54.0.png)


* 1) Drag framework files to Project Navigator of the project and import. Note that added framework files should be added to a project target.
* 2) Also add the **Gamebase.bundle** file to **Copy Bundle Resources**.
![Gamebase.bundle Bundle Resources](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/iOSDevelopersGuide/ios-developers-guide-installation-003_1.0.0.png)
* 3) To use Gamebase, a number of frameworks and library files must be added so that they can be referenced by the linker. This is to include the features of the external SDKs used by Gamebase in addition to the framework of Gamebase. You need to add the following:
    * libicucore.tbd
    * libz.tbd
    * libsqlite3.tbd
    * libc++.tbd
    * AdSupport.framework
    * ImageIO.framework
    * GameKit.framework
    * StoreKit.framework
    * Security.framework
    * AuthenticationServices.framework (Optional)
    * AppTrackingTransparency.framework (Optional)

![Link Binary With Libraries](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/iOSDevelopersGuide/ios-developers-guide-installation-005_1.0.0.png)

* 4) When using **Gamebase iOS SDK 2.12.0 or later**, additional settings are required as Facebook SDK is updated.
    * Adding **Accelerate.framework**
    * Add an **empty swift file** within the project (When there are not any swift files within the project)
* 5) Go to **Target > Build Settings > Linking > Other Linker Flags** and add **-ObjC**.
![Other Linker Flags](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/iOSDevelopersGuide/ios-developers-guide-installation-006_1.0.0.png)
* 6) When using NaverAuthAdapter, the **NaverThirdPartyLogin.framework** file provided by NAVER SDK should be added to **Target > Build Phases > Embeded Frameworks**.
 ![Naver Embeded Frameworks](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/iOSDevelopersGuide/ios-developers-guide-started-001_1.8.0.png)
 * 7) When using LineAuthAdapter, the **LineSDK.xcframework** file provided by LINE SDK should be added to **Target > Build Phases > Embeded Frameworks**.
 ![LINE Embeded Frameworks](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/iOSDevelopersGuide/ios-developers-guide-started-001_1.9.1.png)

> [INFO]
>
> The **-ObjC option** to the Linker allows all Objective-C classes and categories of Static Library to be loaded. <br/>
> Therefore, if this option is not set, an error like **selector not recognized** may occur during runtime.
>

<br/>

> <font color="red">[Caution]</font><br/>
>
> * When building with Unity (2019.3 or later), import the Gamebase iOS SDK only to the **UnityFramework** target.
> * When you run Unity build, **Unity-iPhone** and **UnityFramework** are created in the Xcode project target.
> * Note that there may be problems with operation if you import the Gamebase iOS SDK in duplicate for each target.
> 

### CocoaPods Settings

You can set the Gamebase iOS SDK with CocoaPods.

* 1) Execute Xcode to create a project.
* 2) Execute the terminal to navigate to the directory of the project where CocoaPods will be applied.
* 3) Execute the **pod init** command to create **Podfile**.
* 4) Open the created **Podfile** with the editor and enter the following.

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'

target 'SampleApplication' do
    pod 'Gamebase'
    pod 'GamebaseAuthFacebookAdapter'
    pod 'GamebaseAuthGamecenterAdapter'
    pod 'GamebaseAuthPaycoAdapter'
    pod 'GamebaseAuthNaverAdapter'
    pod 'GamebaseAuthTwitterAdapter'
    pod 'GamebaseAuthGoogleAdapter'
    pod 'GamebaseAuthLineAdapter'
    pod 'GamebaseAuthAppleidAdapter'
    pod 'GamebaseAuthWeiboAdapter'
    pod 'GamebasePushAdapter'
    pod 'GamebasePurchaseIAPAdapter'

    # Regarding how to use the following modules, please contact the Customer Center.
    pod 'GamebaseAuthHangameAdapter'
    pod 'GamebaseAuthKakaogameAdapter'
end
```

> [Note]
>
> Enter the target name of the created project in the **target 'SampleApplication' do** part.<br/>
> You can specify versions by writing in this way: **pod 'Gamebase', '2.48.0'**. If no version is specified in each pod, the newest version is used.<br/>
> Only some specific Adapters can be selected and applied.
> 

<br/>

> <font color="red">[Caution]</font><br/>
>
> If you do not use the latest Gamebase version, some adapter may not be available.
>

* 5) Install Gamebase using the **pod install** or **pod update** command after Podfile is written.
* 6) A **[project name].xcworkspace** file will be created when the installation is complete. From this point on, product is developed using the created **xcworkspace** file.
