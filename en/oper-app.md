Go to the NHN Cloud Cloud Console and click **Game > Gamebase > App**.

* **App**: Manage app information
* **Client**: Manage client version and status information
* **Install URL**: Manage installation URL of each app store


## App

When the Gamebase service is activated, the app is automatically created and only the registered information can be edited from the menu.
Since only one Gamebase app can be managed per NHN Cloud project, you cannot register additional apps or delete exiting apps. When the Gamebase service is deactivated, the information registered in the app is deleted.
For more detailed information on each item, see the details below:

### Basic information
![gamebase_app_01_202009](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/Operators_Guide/gamebase_app_01_202009.png)

#### (1) Installation URL
Shortened URL information that can be used to install and promote the app.
Even if there are multiple stores to which the app is deployed, you can manage them with a single URL.
See the following link for more information on the operation and maintenance of this app. [Manage installation URL](./oper-app/#installed-url)

> [Note]
> When Gamebase is activated, it is automatically created and cannot be changed.

#### (2) Whether to include test payments
Decides whether or not to include test payments in the app's indexes.
"Include Test Payments" is the default option and if you set it to "Exclude Test Payments", the test payments are all excluded from the Analytics revenue indexes.

> [Notes 1]
>  Since the data always accumulate test payments and actual payments regardless of the index inclusion settings, the data collection result won't be affected whether or not test payments are displayed.

> [Notes 2]
> For the payments that occur after setting Exclude Test Payments, the test payments are excluded from the Analytics revenue indexes.

> [Note3]
> Test data is supported only by Google and AppStore. Other stores do not support test data.
> The test index standard for each store is as follows:
> * Google: The history of payments made by the test accounts registered with Google
> * AppStore: The history of payments made in the sandbox environment

#### (3) Period of Pending Withdrawal
Set the grace period if you want to enable the Pending Withdrawal feature.
The default is 7 days and it can be anywhere between 1 and 30 days.
> [Note]
> The services are available as usual during the grace period.

### Server address
![gamebase_app_01_202004](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/gamebase_app_02_202012.png)

- Used when the game needs to receive the server address (e.g. IP, URL) in real time.
- If you configure the server address, you can see the entered information in Launching Information after the client is initialized.
- Server address can be configured according to the client's status and the server address can be checked in Launching Information.
- Enter information only if required by the game; otherwise, leave it empty.

### Language settings
![gamebase_app_01_202004](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/gamebase_app_03_202004.png)

> If **Do Not Verify** is selected, only internal tokens are validated without revalidating the token of the external IdP.
> If **Always Verify** is selected, not only the internal tokens issued by Gamebase but also external IdP tokens are validated every time.

### In-app URL
![gamebase_app_01_202004](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/Operators_Guide/gamebase_app_05_202009.png)
You can edit URLs frequently used in the app in real time via Console without having to redeploy the client.
