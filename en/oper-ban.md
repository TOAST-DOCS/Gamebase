## Game > Gamebase > Console Guide > Ban

Gamebase bans those game users who use apps inappropriately or abusively.
When a banned user tries to log in again, or session is restored, a pop-up will be displayed to restrict game use.

You can register banning either manually in the Gamebase Console or automatically with NHN Cloud Cloud AppGuard by using registered patterns.

Refer to [AppGuard](./oper-ban/#appguard) on how to integrate AppGuard.

- **Linking**: Enable this if you want to automatically register the users detected or restricted by AppGuard as Gamebase-banned users.
- There are two types of **Auto Ban**: **Immediate Block** and **Conditional Block**.
    - Banning by **Immediate Block** is performed at 15 and 45 minutes of every hour. For **Immediate Block**, the detection period cannot be set, and the number of detection is fixed to one.
    - Banning by **Conditional Block** is performed once a day at midnight.
        - Example: If "Detection Period: 5" and "Detection Count: 3" are set for tampering
            - If a user's tampering activity is detected 3 or more times during the period of January 14-18, user ban will be registered on January 19 at midnight.
- There are two types of **Ban Type**: **Permanent Ban** and **Conditional Ban**.
    - **Permanent Ban** permanently bans the users who meet the automatic ban conditions.
    - **Conditional Ban** bans the users who meet the automatic ban conditions for a set period.
- If you select **Delete Leaderboard**, Leaderboard data will also be deleted for users who have been automatically banned.

> [Note]

> In case banning is automatically registered due to AppGuard integration, it will be registered as 'AppGuard' in the registration system.
