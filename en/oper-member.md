Retrieve information of members who are logged in a game.


## Search Member

Enter User ID to search for member information.
User ID is a user identifier which is automatically issued at a first-time login by Gamebase. To lessen confusion while delivered, "ABCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTWXYZ1346789" are applied only, in order to prevent confusion due to similar pronunciation.
IdP is not used for signing in or out, but serves as a unique identifier provided from Id Provider. So you need to be cautious when you want to search by IdP.

Detailed information of searched users are displayed in the above, while history data such as login, mapping, purchase, ban, and playtime are shown under, as taps.

#### Changing Account Status
![gamebase_member_02_201812_en](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/gamebase_member_02_201812_en.png)

- **Banned**: You can lift a ban on the account.
- **Withdrawn**: 'Modify Status' button won't be shown.

**Identity Provider **

In Gamebase, many external IdPs can be integrated. In short, a user can log in by registering two IdPs, such as Facebook and Google in one user ID. IdP can be registered when **Login with Specific IDP** or '**Add Mapping'** API is called from SDK.

- **IdP**: External IdPs (Guest, Facebook, PAYCO, or Google)
- **Idp ID**: ID provided by an external IdP (Facebook no, or PAYCO ID)
- **Registration Date**: The first time when a user registered an IdP.

#### Mapping
You can map the user's IdP to other account.
This only works if the target account status is OK.
 *Press the button pointing to the right to map the IdP*.
 You can revoke the change - as long as you didn't press the 'Add Mapping' button - by pressing the subtract button.
 *When a guest account is mapped to an IdP, the guest information will be lost*.
 When the account has only one IdP bound but it's mapped to other account, the account status will change to **Lost** and it can't be used anymore.

##### Mapping Example
