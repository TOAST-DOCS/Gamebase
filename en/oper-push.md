If you select **Send in Local Time** and set it to '2017-01-01 09:00', users of Korean devices receive the push message on '2017-01-01 09:00' Korea Standard Time, and the users with British devices on '2017-01-01 09:00' British Standard Time.
- **Repeated Send**: Periodically sends the same push message. To send the push message in the country standard time of the user's device, select **Send in Local Time**. Select the sending period and time. Enter the sending frequency as **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Monthly**.
	- Daily: Sends the push message daily.
	- Weekly: Pick a certain day to send the message. Multiple days can be selected.
	- Monthly: Sends the push message on a specific date every month. Only a date (1 - 31) can be entered, and more than one dates are allowed. For example, if you want the message to be sent on 1st, 5th, and 10th day of every month, enter 1, 5, and 10.

- **Send to all**: Can be selected based on OS. All users of the selected OS will receive the push message.

#### (4) Target country

Select the country to send the push message to.
- **All countries**: Send the push message to all users.
- **Some countries**: Send the push message to users from the selected countries.
  Typing the country name suggests autocomplete words. If there is no country to enter, please contact our [Customer Center](https://toast.com/support/inquiry).

> [Note]
>
> Criteria for determining the country
> This is determined based on user's **USIM country code**. If there is no USIM, the push message is displayed based on the country setting of the device.

#### (5) Message type

> [Note]
>
> A function provided for compliance with Korea's 'Information Network Law'.
> If the push message is not informational, it must begin with '(Advertisement)' and contain contact information and the instruction for how to opt out.

- **Promotional**: The header '(Advertisement)' is added to the input message, and contains contact information and the instruction on how to opt out. In Korea, advertising push messages (such as Send to All) must be sent as a 'Promotional' message in order to comply with the 'Information Network Law'.
- **Informational**: Only the typed-in text is sent as the push message. For users of non-Korean devices (USIM country code is non-Korean), send it as an 'Informational' message.


> <font color="red">[Important]</font><br/>
>
> Be careful when you enter '(Advertisement)' into the input message after selecting **Promotional** because there can be multiple '(Advertisement)' texts.

#### (6) Message body

Enter the push message to show to users.

The message can be registered in a number of languages, and it will be shown in default language if the user uses a language other than the registered languages. To add a language, click the **Add Message** button at the bottom. To add the language not in the list, please contact our [Customer Center](https://toast.com/support/inquiry).
If you select 'Auto-translate to default language', the message is translated based on what was entered in the default language and fill out the message using the appropriate language set for each one.

> [Note]
>
> If the device does not receive the push message which was already sent,
> it is highly likely that the user did not register the push token. Please make sure the user's push token has been registered.
> To find out how to register a push token in the platform, see the following document.
