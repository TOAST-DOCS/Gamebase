## Game > Gamebase > Unity Developer's Guide > Purchase

This page describes how to set In-App Purchase (IAP).
Gamebase provides an integrated purchase API to easily link IAP of many stores in a game.

> <font color="red">[Caution]</font><br/>
>
> If there is payment-related processing in an external package, the Gamebase payment function may not work properly.

### Settings

For Android and iOS IAP setting, refer to the below documents.<br/>

* [Android Purchase Settings](aos-purchase#settings)<br/>
* [iOS Purchase Settings](ios-purchase#settings)

### Purchase Flow

Purchase of an item can be divided into Purchase Flow, Consume Flow, and Reprocess Flow.
It is recommended to implement the Purchase Flow in the following order:

![purchase flow](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/DevelopersGuide/purchase_flow_001_2.10.0.png)

1. If the previous purchase was not completed normally, the purchase will fail if the reprocessing is not performed. Therefore, call **RequestItemListOfNotConsumed** before the purchase to run reprocessing, so that the Consume Flow is executed if there are any unprovided items.
2. The game client attempts to make a purchase by calling **RequestPurchase** of the Gamebase SDK.
3. If the purchase is successful, call **RequestItemListOfNotConsumed** to check the unconsumed purchase details, and if there is an item to provide, proceed with the Consume Flow.

### Consume Flow

If there's a value on the list of unconsumed purchases, proceed with the Consume Flow in the following order:

> <font color="red">[Caution]</font><br/>
>
> To prevent duplicate provision of an item, always check whether the item is being provided in duplicate in the game server.
>

![consume flow](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/DevelopersGuide/purchase_flow_002_2.40.1.png)

1. The game client makes a request to the game server to consume the purchase item.
    * Passes UserID, gamebaseProductId, paymentSeq, and purchaseToken.
2. The game server checks the game DB to see if there is a history of already providing an item with the same paymentSeq.
    * 2-1. If the item has not been provided yet, call the Gamebase server's Payment Transaction API to verify that the paymentSeq and purchaseToken values are valid.
        * [Game > Gamebase > API Guide > Purchase(IAP) > Get Payment Transaction](./api-guide/#get-payment-transaction)
    * 2-2. If purchaseToken is a normal value, provide the item corresponding to gamebaseProductId to UserID.
    * 2-3. After providing the item, store UserID, gamebaseProductId, paymentSeq, and purchaseToken in the game DB to prevent duplicate provision or allow for re-provision.
3. Regardless of whether the item has been provided, the game server completes the item provision by calling the Gamebase server's consume API.
    * [Game > Gamebase > API Guide > Purchase(IAP) > Consume](./api-guide/#consume)

### Retry Transaction Flow

![retry transaction flow](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/DevelopersGuide/purchase_retry_transaction_flow_2.19.0.png)

* There are cases where the store purchase has been made successfully but the process was not properly completed due to errors.
* Call **RequestItemListOfNotConsumed** to run reprocessing and proceed with the Consume Flow for any unprovided items.
* It is recommended to call reprocessing at the following times:
    * After login is completed
    * Before making a purchase
    * When entering the store (or lobby) in a game
    * When checking the user profile or mailbox

### Purchase Item

Request a purchase by using the gamebaseProductId of the item to purchase.<br/>
The gamebaseProductId is generally the same as the ID of item registered at the store, but it can be changed in the Gamebase console. 
Additional information entered in the payload field is maintained at the **PurchasableReceipt.payload** field after a successful payment, so it can be used for many purposes.<br/>

> <font color="red">[Caution]</font><br/>
>
> The AMAZON store does not support the **payload** field.
>

When a game user cancels purchase, the **PURCHASE_USER_CANCELED** error is returned.
Please process cancellation.

### List Non-Consumed Items

Request for the list of non-consumed purchases, in which items were not properly consumed (delivered or provided) after purchase.  
In case there is any non-purchased item, request the game server (item server) to proceed with item delivery (provision).
If the purchase was not completed normally, this API also serves the reprocessing function, so call it in the following situations:

* Check if there's any unprovided items for a game user
    * After login is completed
    * When entering the store (or lobby) of a game
    * When checking the user profile or mailbox
* Check if there's any item in need of reprocessing
    * Before making a purchase
    * After a purchase fails

### List Subscriptions Status

The list returned in the callback contains information about the subscription products.
