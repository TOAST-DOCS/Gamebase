### Setting Tool Update

If the Setting Tool needs to be updated, the Setting Tool informs whether update is available or not.
Depending on the update type, some functions provided by Setting Tool may be limited.

#### Force update

* Update required
* SDK download limited
	* You can install or uninstall using the SDK downloaded before.

![Select Build System](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/UnityDevelopersGuide/unity-developers-guide-started-settingtool-update-1_1.13.0.png)

#### Selective update

* Select update
* SDK download available

![Select Build System](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/UnityDevelopersGuide/unity-developers-guide-started-settingtool-update-2_1.13.0.png)

### Add Facebook Authentication

Facebook SDK for iOS and Android are included in Facebook SDK.

![Select Build System](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/UnityDevelopersGuide/unity-developers-guide-started-settingtool-facebook_001.jpg)

When you enable Facebook authentication in Unity settings

![Select Build System](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/UnityDevelopersGuide/unity-developers-guide-started-settingtool-facebook_002.png)

and also enable Facebook authentication in Android and iOS settings,

![Select Build System](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/UnityDevelopersGuide/unity-developers-guide-started-settingtool-facebook_003.png)

Facebook SDKs are included as duplicate in the project, resulting in errors such as authentication failure or build failure.
To prevent such errors, SettingTool is configured to prevent the user from enabling Facebook authentication both in **Unity settings** and **Android & iOS settings**.

> `[Caution]`
> You cannot enable Facebook authentication both in Unity settings and Android & iOS settings.
> When you enable Facebook authentication in Unity settings, you need to [Download Facebook SDK for Unity](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/unity/).

Refer to the table below for SettingTool settings for each game company.

| | **SettingTool > Unity** settings > Enable Facebook authentication | **SettingTool > Android, iOS** settings > Enable Facebook authentication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Features required for games | Gamebase Facebook Login (Android, iOS)<br>Use features such as ShareLink or FeedShare | Gamebase Facebook Login (Android, iOS) |
| Android, iOS Login API | [Gamebase Login with Credential](https://docs.toast.com/en/Game/Gamebase/en/unity-authentication/#login-with-credential) | [Gamebase Login with ID Provider](https://docs.toast.com/en/Game/Gamebase/en/unity-authentication/#login-with-idp) |
| Download Facebook SDK for Unity | O | X |

* Case 1. When only using Gamebase Facebook login on Android and iOS platforms
    * Enable Facebook authentication in **SettingTool > Android, iOS** settings.
* Case 2. When you need to use Gamebase Facebook login and Facebook's FeedShare function in your Unity project
    * Enable Facebook authentication in **SettingTool > Unity** settings.
    * Gamebase does not support functions other than Facebook authentication, so you must implement it yourself using the Facebook SDK for Unity.
* Case 3. When you enable Facebook authentication in **SettingTool > Android, iOS** settings, and Facebook SDK for Unity is included in your project
    * If you are only using Gamebase Facebook Login, please remove the Facebook SDK for Unity included in your project.
    * If you are using Facebook's FeedShare function other than Gamebase Facebook login, enable Facebook authentication in  **SettingTool > Unity**  settings.
        * In this case, if Android or iOS settings are configured, they are automatically released.

### Android Lifecycle

To manage lifecycle, set "com.toast.gamebase.activity.GamebaseMainActivity" as the MainActivity.
"com.toast.gamebase.activity.GamebaseMainActivity" has been inherited from "com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerNativeActivity".

> <font color="red">[Caution]</font>
>
> AndroidPlugin should be developed in inheritance of GamebaseMainActivity.
> GamebaseMainActivity is included to GamebasePlugin.jar.
> The launchMode should be a singleTask (Unity&'s default activity will also be fixed as singleTask). Otherwise, crash may occur when an app starts.
> 
> To change the Lifecycle, you need to activate Project Settings > Settings for Android > Publish Settings > Build > Custom Main Manifest and edit the AndroidManifest.xml.

> <font color="red">[Caution]</font>
> 
> When setting Android's targetSdkVersion to 31 or higher, you must declare the android:exported attribute in the tag where the intent-filter exists.
> Even when setting **GamebaseMainActivity**, which is provided by Gamebase to manage lifecycle, as MainActivity, **android:exported="true"** must be added to the attribute.

```xml
<manifest>
	...
    <application>
    ...
    	<activity android:name="com.toast.android.gamebase.activity.GamebaseMainActivity"
        	android:launchMode="singleTask"
        	android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|screenLayout|screenSize|orientation"
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            android:exported="true">
            <intent-filter>
            	<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    ...
    </application>
    ...
</manifest>
```

### iOS Settings

> <font color="red">[Caution]</font>
>
> * Caution for Unity 2019.3 or later
>     * Go to TARGETS > UnityFramework and add iOS SDK setting.
>

1. Perform iOS build in the Unity project.
2. Add the setting to the created XCode project.       
    * [iOS SDK Settings Guide](./ios-started)
