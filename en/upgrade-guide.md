## Game > Gamebase > Upgrade Guide

## 2.6.0

### Unity

#### Android Limitation

* With Android Support Library upgraded to 28.0.0, an Android build fails in Unity 5, Unity 2017.1, and Unity 2017.2.  
	* If your Editor is below Unity 2017.4, install a higher version than Unity 2017.4, copy the 'Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/Tools/gradle/lib' folder and paste it to the same path of your current Unity Editor; then, modify the mainTemplate.gradle file like below.

```groovy
// GENERATED BY UNITY. REMOVE THIS COMMENT TO PREVENT OVERWRITING WHEN EXPORTING AGAIN
buildscript {
	repositories {
		jcenter()
        // >>> For download Gradle Android Plugin
        maven {
            url 'https://maven.google.com'
        }
	}

	dependencies {
		//classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.1.0'
        // >>> Update Gradle Android Plugin version
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.3.0'
	}
}
```

#### Firebase Push

* In case of using Firebase Cloud Messaging, download a google-services.json file from Firebase Console and convert it into XML. Include XML resource in your project.
    * XML resource is required in Gamebase version 2.6.0 or higher. Under 2.6.0, Firebase Push works without XML resource.
* Refer to the below guide for implementation.
    * [\[Game > Gamebase > Android Developer's Guide > Push > Settings > Firebase\]](./aos-push/#firebase)

#### Standalone

* Removed Japan Purchase
	* Faded out Japan Purchase.
	* If you're using GamebaseUnitySDK_IAPAdapter, please delete the folders like below:
        * Asset/Toast/Common
        * Asset/Toast/Core
        * Asset/Toast/IAP
        * Asset/Toast/Standalone

### Android

#### Limitation

* Changed the minSdkVersion from 15 (IceCreamSandwichMR1, 4.0.3) to 16 (JellyBean, 4.1).
	* When your minSdkVersion of the project is 15, since normal operation is not ensured for any device below OS 4.1, change it to 16.

#### Removed APIs

* Following functions have been removed: replace them with alternatives.
    * Removed **Gamebase.getAuthBanInfo()**: replace it with **Gamebase.getBanInfo()**.
    * Removed **Gamebase.getLanguageCode()**: replace it with **Gamebase.getDeviceLanguageCode()**.
    * Removed **new GamebaseConfiguration.Builder(void)**: replace it with  **GamebaseConfiguration.newBuilder()**.
    * Removed **new GamebaseConfiguration.Builder.setAppId()**: replace it with  **GamebaseConfiguration.newBuilder()**.
    * Removed **new GamebaseConfiguration.Builder.setAppVersion()**: replace it with **GamebaseConfiguration.newBuilder()**.

#### Changed / Deprecated APIs

* No need to call Gamebase.activeApp() any more since it is automatically called.
* Change the method of creating GamebaseConfiguration, which is required as parameter of Gamebase.initialize().
    * Call **GamebaseConfiguration.newBuilder()**, instead of **new GamebaseConfiguration.Builder(String, String)**.
* Do not call LaunchingStatus.isPlayable() any more.
	* See [\[Game > Gamebase > Android SDK User Guide > Initialization > Launching Information\]](./aos-initialization/#launching-information) and decide if game play is available according to the Launching Status Code.
* Purchase
    * Since store code cannot be changed, it must be delivered at  **GamebaseConfiguration.newBuilder()**.
        * Gamebase.Purchase.getStoreCode() / Gamebase.Purchase.setStoreCode() is scheduled to be removed. Do not use it again.
    * No need to call Gamebase.Purchase.requestRetryTransaction() any more.
* Push
    * Since Gamebase Android SDK 2.6.0, push messages must be sent out via menu of the **Push** tab on the Gamebase console.
        * For Gamebase Android SDK 2.6.0 or lower versions, push must be sent from the **Push(Old)** tab of the Gamebase console.
    * No need to call GamebaseConfiguration.Builder.setFCMSenderId() any more.
    * When GamebaseConfiguration.Builder.setTencentAccessKey(),  GamebaseConfiguration.Builder.setTencentAccessId() is being called, remove the API call and declare for build.gradle as follows:

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        // >>> For Tencent Push Notification
        manifestPlaceholders = [
            XG_ACCESS_ID : "1234567890",
            XG_ACCESS_KEY : "ABCDEFGHIJKL",
        ]
    }
}
```

### iOS

* No special steps are required.

## 2.4.4

### Unity

* Updated the setting tool.
    * Due to changes in the folder structure, the previous SettingTool must be completely removed before re-installed. 

## 2.2.2

### Unity

* Changed the variable name from **storeCodeAOS** to **storeCodeAndroid** for the GamebaseUnitySDKSettings class.
    * If there is any code or prefab which defines store code in reference of **storeCodeAOS**, change the variable to **storeCodeAndroid**, so as variable reference does not fail.

## 2.2.0

### Unity

* Changed the Package Name of GamebaseMainActivity.
    * Unless the MainActivity declaration of AndroidManifest.xml is changed like below, crash may occur:
    * **com.toast.gamebase.activity.GamebaseMainActivity** -> **com.toast.android.gamebase.activity.GamebaseMainActivity**

```xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <application>
    ...
        <activity android:name="com.toast.android.gamebase.activity.GamebaseMainActivity"
            android:launchMode="singleTask"
            android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|screenLayout|screenSize|orientation"
            android:label="@string/app_name">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    ...
    </application>
    ...
</manifest>
```

## 2.1.0

	* If you need guest account transfer, go to [\[Game > Gamebase > Unity SDK User Guide > Authentication > TransferAccount\]](./unity-authentication/#transferaccount), updated as of Gamebase SDK 2.2.1.
