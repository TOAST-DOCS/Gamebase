### Authentication

Gamebase supports OAuth login based on ID and passwords, using accounts of many identity providers (IdPs); guest login by using UUID of a device. Its authentication service is based on member information provided by external IdP, without having its own member system. In other words, user's ID or passwords are not saved in Gamebase.

* **Provides many authentication methods via single interface. **
  Development costs can be saved by enabling external IdP development easier and faster.  Developers can easily implement authentication without concerning complicated procedure and legal or policy issues.

* **Provides various external IdP authentication methods.**
  Provided external authentication is to be continuously updated, and if there is any other authentication you'd like to include, contact [Customer Center](https://toast.com/support/inquiry).

Following is the list of external authentication supported by Gamebase.

| External Authentication             | Android | iOS | Windows(based Unity) |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Facebook          | O | O | O |
| Sign In with Apple | O  | O | |
| Apple Game Center |  | O | |
| Google            | O | O | O |
| PAYCO             | O | O | O |
| NAVER             | O | O | O |
| Twitter			| O | O | |
| LINE				| O | O | O  |
| Hangame			| O | O | O  |
| Weibo				| O | O |   |

* **Provides guest logins.**
  With guest login, users can log in and start a game without any authentication required. As Gamebase user ID is issued even to guest users, game data can be managed for all users, regardless of OAuth or guest login
  
* **Provides independent member identification.**
  On a first-time login, Gamebase user ID is automatically created, which can be used as user identifier in a game. User ID is issued to all users, regardless of authentication method, and is not inclusive to a particular IdP, so user processing is available in the same method throughout any IdP.
  
* **Provides log-out and withdrawal.**
  You can choose to log out and log in again from different authentication, and if you withdraw from a game, user ID will be deleted from Gamebase with all related information.
  
* **Provides mapping so that a game user can use multiple external IdPs at the same time.**
  For example, a game user with Facebook authentication can use the same ID with Google authentication. If Facebook authentication is mapped with Google authentication to a user ID, the user can play games with Facebook authentication and Google authentication, each on two different devices.

### Payment

Game companies can enjoy maximum profits with less efforts by releasing already available games to many stores. Since Gamebase supports easy integration with many stores, you're not required a full knowledge of payment integration conditions of each major store.  

Gamebase supports the following stores: 
* Google Play Store
* App Store
* Galaxy Store
* ONE Store
* Facebook
* Amazon

* **In-app purchase of many stores on a single interface** 
  Since further store development gets easy and fast via single-interface API, you can save development costs. Developers can easily implement purchase without having to learn the complexity of integration.  
* **Standalone payment verification server for secure and stable purchases **
  Gamebase helps to stabilize purchase transactions by setting up a seperate server to verify payment with external stores. Given the network status could be unstable, payment retries and item credits are managed separately.   
* **Buying as well as subscription and promotion **
  The subscription feature of Google PlayStore and Appstore is enabled to sell users monthly products. Google's promotion is also available in each game without further implementation. More features of external stores are to be added to Gamebase.  
* **Flawless response to customer inquiries supported by web console features (e.g. query purchase list**
  On the web console, user can check his purchase list and item credit status; can even cancel purchase and respond to abusive acts.

### Launching

A game app in service requires lots of information when it first launches. Gamebase provides data required to operate the game app during initial execution, which is called Launching. 
Launching data can be set in the Gamebase Console in real time, and the changes can be checked when initializing SDK or at game launching status.

Following information is provided by Gamebase for launching.

* App status
  * Whether to update game client, and download URL
  * Maintenance information
* Urgent notice
* Authentication
* URL list of in-app games

### For Global

Gamebase basically supports global games, and provides following functions to that purpose:

* Provides user messages in multiple languages.
  * User messages can be entered in multiple languages via console, but, language set follows user device's setting. If Korean, English, and Japanese are entered via console, users of Korean device will be displayed with Korean messages.
* Allows filtering by country.
  * In case urgent notice or push messages are directed at users of a particular country during game operations, the messages can be sent to a specified country only. 
* Selects operator's local time zone to enter time at ease.
  * If a game is run in Vietnam, Vietnam’s time zone can be selected and entered, with no need to convert to Korean time.

### Using the other NHN Cloud Service

* Supports easier interfaces to TOAST service that a game requires.
  * Gamebase provides wrapped APIs on the basis of Gamebase User IDs. Therefore, users don't need to make separate calls to each service's API.
  * [Notification > PUSH](http://www.toast.com/service/notification) : Integrated push service to send push messages  
  * [Game > Leaderboard](http://www.toast.com/service/leaderboard) : Real-time large-capacity ranking service
  * [Security > AppGuard](https://cloud.toast.com/service/security) : Prevents code manipulation of applications in real time
