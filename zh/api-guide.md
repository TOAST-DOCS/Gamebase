## Advance Notice

Gamebase Server API provides APIs as follows, in the RESTful format. Following information is required to use Server API.

#### Server Address

To call API, below address is needed, which is also available in the Gamebase Console.
> https://api-gamebase.nhncloudservice.com

![image alt](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/Server_Developers_Guide/pre_server_address_v1.3.png)

#### AppId

App ID, as a project ID of NHN Cloud, can be found on the **Project List** page of the Console.

![image alt](http://static.toastoven.net/prod_gamebase/Server_Developers_Guide/pre_appId_v1.2.png)

#### SecretKey

Secret Key, as a control access of API, can be found in the Gamebase Console. It must be set at the HTTP header to call Server API.
> [Note]<br>
> When a secret key is exposed and a wrong call is made, click **Create** to create a new secret key and replace the old one.

#### TransactionId

As part of managing API internally within a server that calls API, TransactionId is provided. By setting a transaction ID at the HTTP header from a calling server to call API, the Gamebase server delivers results with corresponding TransactionId set at the response HTTP Header and Response Body Header of results.

## Common

#### HTTP Header

Following items should be set at the HTTP Header to call API.

| Name | Required | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Content-Type | Required | application/json; charset=UTF-8 |
| X-Secret-Key | Required | Refer to description of SecretKey  |
| X-TCGB-Transaction-Id | Optional | Refer to description of TransactionId |

#### API Response

As a response to all API requests, **HTTP 200 OK** is delivered. Whether an API request is successful or not can be determined in reference of the Header of Response Body.

**[Request]**

```
Content-Type: application/json
X-TCGB-Transaction-Id: 88a1ae42-6b1d-48c8-894e-54e97aca07fq
X-Secret-Key: IgsaAP
GET https://api-gamebase.nhncloudservice.com
```

**[Response]**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
X-TCGB-Transaction-Id: 88a1ae42-6b1d-48c8-894e-54e97aca07fq
```

```json
{
    "header": {
        "transactionId": "88a1ae42-6b1d-48c8-894e-54e97aca07fq",
        "isSuccessful": true,
        "resultCode": 0,
        "resultMessage": "Success."
    }
}
```

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| transactionId | String | The value set at HTTP Header when API is requested.<br>If the value is not delivered, return value that is created within Gamebase. |
| isSuccessful | boolean | Whether it is successful or not.  |
| resultCode | int | Result code<br>0 for success; return error codes, for failure |
| resultMessage | String | Result message  |

#### API Version

When a specific variable type in the API response result changes, the API version changes. That is, even if a new API is added or a new variable is added to the response result, the API version does not change.

> [Caution]
> Make sure that you add the option of the JSON library you are using so that a JSON parsing error does not occur even if a new variable is added to the API response result.

#### Get IdP Token and Profiles

Gamebase Access Token which is issued upon successful login with "Login with IdP" from the client side. It retrieves the Access Token and Profiles information of the IdP used for login.

> [Caution]
> IdP's Access Token expiration date varies by IdP, and they are usually short.
> If you successfully log in with "Login as the Latest Login IdP" from the client and call the API from the server, you may not be able to acquire IdP info because IdP's Access Token has been expired.

<br/>

> [Note]
> There are also IdPs that are unable to acquire information with the IdP's Access Token only.
> Example: appleid / iosgamecenter / kakaogame : There is no information you can retrieve from Server to Server with Access Token.

## Purchase (IAP)

#### Consume

If the store payment (Google Play Store, App Store, ONEStore, etc.) has been made successfully, it issues the purchased items to the user, records the purchase history in the server, and then informs the Gamebase of the payment consumption. You can consume payment only once per payment, and the payment is not consumed if the payment status is not normal.

> [Note]
> Only the item payment with the product type CONSUMABLE or CONSUMABLE_AUTO_RENEWABLE at the time of registration will be consumed.
> Can consume once per payment, and IAP regards any payment without consumption as not issuing the purchased item.

Unconsumed payment history can be viewed through SDK and View Unconsumed Payment History API. Even if the unconsumed payment history exists through the API, the provisioning history within the game server becomes the priority if the game server has the history about the item provisioning.
(If an API timeout occurs due to a network failure, etc., there might be cases where payment is completed in Gamebase whereas the item is not issued to the user due to API response failure in the game server.)

> [Note]
> If it is not possible to manage all item issuance history inside the game, a safety measure for a duplicate issuance or non-issuance issue is required, for example, by setting the request timeout of API to 10 seconds or longer, and logging the history at least when an API timeout occurs.
