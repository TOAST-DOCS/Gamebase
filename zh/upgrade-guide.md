        * [Game > Gamebase > Android SDK User Guide > Getting Started > Setting > Android 11](./aos-started/#android-11)
* Please contact [Customer Service]( https://toast.com/support/inquiry) if you need support for an earlier version of AGP.

#### AndroidX

* Please apply the following changes to Gradle since the dependency of the Android Support Library has been changed to AndroidX.

* Add migration declarations for libraries that do not support AndroidX in the gradle.properties file.

```groovy
# >>> [AndroidX]
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

* Add Java 8 build settings for the latest AndroidX to the build.gradle file.

```groovy
android {
    compileOptions {
        // >>> [AndroidX]
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

#### Under AGP 3.4.0

* If the Android Gradle Plugin version is lower than 3.4.0, the build will fail, so the following declaration is required in the gradle.properties file:

```groovy
# gradle.properties
# >>> Fix for AGP under 3.4.0
android.enableD8.desugaring=true
android.enableIncrementalDesugaring=false
```

#### LINE IdP

* When using the LINE IdP, the build may fail depending on the AGP version as there is a **&lt;queries&gt;** tag inside the LINE SDK.
    * Please refer to the following guide to upgrade to the AGP version that can build the 'queries' tag.
    * [Game > Gamebase > Android SDK User Guide > Getting Started > Setting > Android 11](./aos-started/#android-11)
* If you are using the LINE IdP, an error may occur in Manifest merger when building an application because **android:allowBackup="false"** is declared in LINE SDK. If a build fails for this reason, declare **tools:replace="android:allowBackup"** in the application tag as follows.

```xml
<application
      tools:replace="android:allowBackup"
      ... >
```

### iOS

* Changed to return TCGB_ERROR_AUTH_EXTERNAL_LIBRARY_ERROR (3009) error when an ASAuthorizationErrorUnknown error occurs in Sign In with an Apple OS.

### Unity

* If you're using this version, you need to manually delete **Assets/Gamebase/Toast/IAP/Plugins** before use.
    * If Gamebase Unity SDK 2.27.0 or higher is applied, you do not need to delete it.

#### Changed Minimum Support Version

* The minimum Unity version changed from April 16, 2017 to April 0, 2018.
* Please contact [Customer Service]( https://toast.com/support/inquiry) if you need support for an older version of Unity.

#### AndroidX Build

* Please add the following declaration when building Android due to AndroidX migration of the Gamebase Android SDK.
* 2019.3 or earlier

```groovy
// mainTemplate.gradle
([rootProject] + (rootProject.subprojects as List)).each {
    ext {
        it.setProperty("android.useAndroidX", true)
        it.setProperty("android.enableJetifier", true)
    }
}
```

* 2019.3 or later

```groovy
// gradleTemplate.properties
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

#### Under AGP 3.4.0

* If the Unity Editor version is 2018.4.3 or lower or 2019.1.6 or lower, the build will fail because the AGP version is low (3.2.0), so add the following declaration.

```groovy
// mainTemplate.gradle
([rootProject] + (rootProject.subprojects as List)).each {
    ext {
        // >>> Fix for AGP under 3.4.0
        it.setProperty("android.enableD8.desugaring", true)
        it.setProperty("android.enableIncrementalDesugaring", false)
    }
}
```

### Unreal

#### AndroidX Build

* Please add the following declaration to UPL when building Android due to AndroidX migration of the Gamebase Android SDK.

```xml
<gradleProperties>    
  <insert>      
    android.useAndroidX=true      
    android.enableJetifier=true    
  </insert>  
</gradleProperties>
```

## 2.21.2

### iOS

* If you enable bitcode and **archive build** in Gamebase iOS SDK 2.21.1, error occurs.
    * If you want to use bitcode, use Gamebase iOS SDK 2.21.2 to avoid any associated error.

## 2.21.0

### Android

* If a wrong jCenter build is deployed so that **jcenter()** was declared before **mavenCentral()** was declared in Gamebase Android SDK 2.21.0, all Gamebase APIs might crash.
    * In this case, use a properly deployed Gamebase Android SDK 2.21.1 or declare **mavenCentral()** ahead of **jcenter()**.
* Maven Repository
    * As jCenter stopped providing services to individual users, ( [https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/](https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/) ) new builds can no longer be uploaded.(Users will not be able to access jCenter starting from February 1st, 2022.)
    * For this reason, since Gamebase Android SDK 2.21.0 and later versions will be deployed only to **mavenCentral()** and not to **jcenter()**, please add mavenCentral to gradle repository.

```groovy
repositories {
    // >>> For Gamebase SDK
    mavenCentral()
    ...
}
```

#### LINE IdP

* If you are using LINE IdP, due to the LINE SDK update, you must configure **JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8** in Gradle to make the build succeed.

```groovy
android {
    compileOptions {
        // >>> [LINE IdP]
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

### iOS

* Error occurs when using bitcode in Gamebase iOS SDK 2.21.0.
    * If you want to use bitcode, use Gamebase iOS SDK 2.21.1 instead.

## 2.20.2

### iOS

#### Facebook IdP

* In Gamebase iOS SDK 2.20.2, Facebook SDK has been updated to 9.1.0.

#### Android Limitation

* With Android Support Library upgraded to 28.0.0, an Android build fails in Unity 5, Unity 2017.1, and Unity 2017.2.  
	* If your Editor is below Unity 2017.3, install a higher version than Unity 2017.3, copy the 'Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/Tools/gradle/lib' folder and paste it to the same path of your current Unity Editor; then, modify the mainTemplate.gradle file like below.

```groovy
// GENERATED BY UNITY. REMOVE THIS COMMENT TO PREVENT OVERWRITING WHEN EXPORTING AGAIN
buildscript {
	repositories {
		jcenter()
        // >>> For download Gradle Android Plugin
        maven {
            url 'https://maven.google.com'
        }
	}

	dependencies {
		//classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.1.0'
        // >>> Update Gradle Android Plugin version
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.3.0'
	}
}
```

#### Firebase Push

* In case of using Firebase Cloud Messaging, download a google-services.json file from Firebase Console and convert it into XML. Include XML resource in your project.
    * XML resource is required in Gamebase version 2.6.0 or higher. Under 2.6.0, Firebase Push works without XML resource.
* Refer to the below guide for implementation.
    * [\[Game > Gamebase > Android Developer's Guide > Push > Settings > Firebase\]](./aos-push/#firebase)

#### Standalone

* Removed Japan Purchase
	* Faded out Japan Purchase.
	* If you're using GamebaseUnitySDK_IAPAdapter, please delete the folders like below:
        * Asset/Toast/Common
        * Asset/Toast/Core
        * Asset/Toast/IAP
        * Asset/Toast/Standalone

### Android

#### Limitation

* Changed the minSdkVersion from 15 (IceCreamSandwichMR1, 4.0.3) to 16 (JellyBean, 4.1).
	* When your minSdkVersion of the project is 15, since normal operation is not ensured for any device below OS 4.1, change it to 16.

#### Removed APIs

* Following functions have been removed: replace them with alternatives.
    * Removed **Gamebase.getAuthBanInfo()**: replace it with **Gamebase.getBanInfo()**.
    * Removed **Gamebase.getLanguageCode()**: replace it with **Gamebase.getDeviceLanguageCode()**.
    * Removed **new GamebaseConfiguration.Builder(void)**: replace it with  **GamebaseConfiguration.newBuilder()**.
    * Removed **new GamebaseConfiguration.Builder.setAppId()**: replace it with  **GamebaseConfiguration.newBuilder()**.
    * Removed **new GamebaseConfiguration.Builder.setAppVersion()**: replace it with **GamebaseConfiguration.newBuilder()**.

#### Changed/Deprecated APIs

* No need to call Gamebase.activeApp() any more since it is automatically called.
* Change the method of creating GamebaseConfiguration, which is required as parameter of Gamebase.initialize().
    * Call **GamebaseConfiguration.newBuilder()**, instead of **new GamebaseConfiguration.Builder(String, String)**.
* Do not call LaunchingStatus.isPlayable() any more.
	* See [\[Game > Gamebase > Android SDK User Guide > Initialization > Launching Information\]](./aos-initialization/#launching-information) and decide if game play is available according to the Launching Status Code.
* Purchase
    * Since store code cannot be changed, it must be delivered at  **GamebaseConfiguration.newBuilder()**.
        * Gamebase.Purchase.getStoreCode() / Gamebase.Purchase.setStoreCode() is scheduled to be removed. Do not use it again.
    * No need to call Gamebase.Purchase.requestRetryTransaction() any more.
* Push
    * Since Gamebase Android SDK 2.6.0, push messages must be sent out via menu of the **Push** tab on the Gamebase console.
        * For Gamebase Android SDK 2.6.0 or lower versions, push must be sent from the **Push(Old)** tab of the Gamebase console.
    * No need to call GamebaseConfiguration.Builder.setFCMSenderId() any more.
    * When GamebaseConfiguration.Builder.setTencentAccessKey(),  GamebaseConfiguration.Builder.setTencentAccessId() is being called, remove the API call and declare for build.gradle as follows:

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        // >>> For Tencent Push Notification
        manifestPlaceholders = [
            XG_ACCESS_ID : "1234567890",
            XG_ACCESS_KEY : "ABCDEFGHIJKL",
        ]
    }
}
```

## 2.4.4

### Unity

* Updated the setting tool.
    * Due to changes in the folder structure, the previous SettingTool must be completely removed before re-installed. 

## 2.2.2

### Unity

* Changed the variable name from **storeCodeAOS** to **storeCodeAndroid** for the GamebaseUnitySDKSettings class.
    * If there is any code or prefab which defines store code in reference of **storeCodeAOS**, change the variable to **storeCodeAndroid**, so as variable reference does not fail.

## 2.2.0

### Unity

* Changed the Package Name of GamebaseMainActivity.
    * Unless the MainActivity declaration of AndroidManifest.xml is changed like below, crash may occur:
    * **com.toast.gamebase.activity.GamebaseMainActivity** -> **com.toast.android.gamebase.activity.GamebaseMainActivity**

```xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <application>
    ...
        <activity android:name="com.toast.android.gamebase.activity.GamebaseMainActivity"
            android:launchMode="singleTask"
            android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|screenLayout|screenSize|orientation"
            android:label="@string/app_name">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    ...
    </application>
    ...
</manifest>
```

## 2.1.0

### Common

#### Removed APIs

* Removed TransferKey which is not used.
	* If you need guest account transfer, go to [\[Game > Gamebase > Unity SDK User Guide > Authentication > TransferAccount\]](./unity-authentication/#transferaccount), updated as of Gamebase SDK 2.2.1.
